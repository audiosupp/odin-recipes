      >A little sweetness is all you need and vanilla extract makes it taste
      gourmet. You can get creative with this recipe and use berries instead of
      bananas, flax seeds instead of chia, or any unsweetened nut milk or nut
      butter that you fancy.</q

    <ul>
      <strong>Ingredients</strong>
      <li>1 banana, sliced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened almond butter, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons chia seeds</li>
      <li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
      <li>1 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pure maple syrup</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <strong>Steps</strong>
      <li>
        Place 3 to 4 slices of banana in the bottom of a jar. Layer 1 1/2
        teaspoon of almond butter, 1/2 teaspoon chia seeds, and 1/2 cup oats on
        top. Repeat layering remaining almond butter, chia seeds, and oats,
        leaving a 1-inch gap at the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix almond milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Pour over
        oats, leaving a 1/2-inch gap at the top to allow oats to expands as they
        soak. Push a knife or fork vertically through the jar to make sure milk
        mixture soaks all the way through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover jar tightly and refrigerate until oats are moist, 4 hours to
