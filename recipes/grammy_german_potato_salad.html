    <h1>Grammy's German Potato Salad</h1>
    <q
      >This is a different potato salad for those who don't want a
      mayonnaise-based recipe. My family has enjoyed this for many years, and it
      is easy to adapt by adding more spices that suit your family.</q

    <ul>
      <strong>Ingredients</strong>
      <li>8 white potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dry mustard</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup cider vinegar, divided</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <strong>Steps</strong>
      <li>
        Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a
        boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until just tender, about 15
        minutes; drain.
      </li>
      <li>Put potatoes into a large bowl; add onion and stir.</li>
      <li>
        Mix sugar, mustard, and salt together in a bowl. Stir just enough
        vinegar into the sugar mixture to form a paste; season with black
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk remaining vinegar and vegetable oil together in a separate bowl
        until smooth; stream into bowl with the paste, whisking continually to
        incorporate. Pour the dressing over the potato and onion mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let salad cool slightly, 5 to 10
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
